# Background Removal and Image Processing Tool

This project provides a web-based tool for background removal and image processing. Users can upload images, remove backgrounds, and perform various image processing tasks such as changing backgrounds, detecting blurriness, and measuring image similarity.

## Features:

- **Background Removal:** Utilizes a deep learning model to automatically remove backgrounds from uploaded images.
- **Background Replacement:** Allows users to replace the removed background with a solid color or an image of their choice.
- **Blur Detection:** Detects blur in uploaded images using image processing techniques.
- **Image Similarity Detection:** Computes the similarity between uploaded images and provides a percentage score.
- **Product Description Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate product descriptions based on user-provided keywords.

## Dependencies:

- `colorsys`
- `scipy`
- `glob`
- `torchvision`
- `shlex`
- `tempfile`
- `colorthief`
- `flask`
- `PIL`
- `rembg`
- `numpy`
- `cv2`
- `openai`
- `sentence_transformers`
- `werkzeug`

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask app using `python app.py`.
4. Access the web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Instructions:

- **Upload Image:** Select an image file from your device and upload it to the application.
- **Remove Background:** Automatically remove the background from the uploaded image.
- **Replace Background:** Replace the removed background with a solid color or an image of your choice.
- **Blur Detection:** Detect blur in uploaded images and display the result.
- **Image Similarity:** Compare uploaded images and measure their similarity.
- **Generate Description:** Input keywords and generate a product description based on them.

## Notes:

- Ensure that the uploaded images have valid extensions (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`).
- The web interface provides interactive options for background replacement and other image processing tasks.
- Experiment with different options and functionalities to explore the capabilities of the tool.
